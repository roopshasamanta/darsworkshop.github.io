        <p>Robustness refers to the ability of a system to behave reliably in the presence of perturbation in the system parameters or uncertainty in its environment. This is particularly important in the context of embedded systems and software, which interact with a physical environment through sensors and actuators and communicate over wired or wireless networks. Such systems are routinely subject to deviations arising from sensor/actuation noise, quantization and sampling of data, uncertainty in the physical system/environment and delays/packet drops over unreliable network channels. When deployed in safety critical applications such as avionics and automotive, robustness of such systems in the presence of uncertainty is not just desirable, but crucial.</p>

<p>Our aim is to foster dialogue and exchange of ideas and techniques across these well-established areas. In particular, we will invite experts in formal verification, control theory and hybrid systems with a focus on robustness analysis of embedded software, hardware and cyber-physical systems.</p>
